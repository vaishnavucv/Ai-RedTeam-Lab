# 🛡️ AI/ML/LLM Penetration Testing Resources

Welcome to the **AI/ML/LLM Penetration Testing Resources** repository!

This collection offers a **comprehensive set of tools, articles, labs, and references** to help understand, identify, and mitigate vulnerabilities in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, **Machine Learning (ML)**, and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

Whether you're a cybersecurity professional or just diving into the world of AI security, this repo is designed to equip you with **hands-on knowledge and practical tools** for pentesting AI-powered systems.

## 🌟 Why is AI/ML/LLM Pentesting Important?

As AI becomes embedded into healthcare, finance, law, and beyond, securing these models is more crucial than ever. Vulnerabilities in AI/LLM systems can lead to:

- 🕵️ Sensitive Information Disclosure  
- 🤖 Malicious Model Behavior (bias, hallucinations, offensive outputs)  
- 🚫 Service Disruption (DoS attacks)  
- 📦 Intellectual Property Theft  
- 🛠️ Supply Chain Compromises  

This repository helps you address these risks by learning how to break (ethically) and fix these systems.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get the most from this repository, basic knowledge in the following areas is helpful:

- 🔬 AI & ML Concepts (model training, data pipelines)
- 🧠 Large Language Models (architecture & applications)
- 🧑‍💻 Traditional Pentesting (XSS, SQLi, API security)
- 🐍 Python Programming (most tools/scripts are Python-based)

## 📚 Resources Overview

### 💡 AI/LLM Introduction & Fundamentals

- **What is AI?**  
  Machines simulating human intelligence (learning, reasoning, problem-solving).

- **Language Models & LLMs**  
  Models that understand and generate human language (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude).

- **Training LLMs**  
  Using massive text datasets to learn syntax, meaning, and knowledge.

- **Development Lifecycle**  
  `Problem → Data Collection → Model Design → Training → Evaluation → Deployment → Monitoring`

- **Tokenization**  
  Breaking text into machine-readable units (tokens).

## 🚨 AI/LLM Attack Landscape

### 🔥 Core Attack Categories

- **Misalignment**: Offensive outputs, hallucinations, bias  
- **Jailbreaks**: Prompt overwriting, system instruction manipulation  
- **Prompt Injections**: Exfiltration, plugin abuse, instruction overriding  

### 🧪 Injection Techniques

- “Ignore previous instructions”  
- Obfuscation with emojis, encoding, or switching languages  
- Exploiting plugin capabilities (email, web browsing, API calls)  
- Markdown image/data exfiltration  
- Injection across multiple file formats (text, image, audio, video)

## ⚔️ OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications

Adapted from OWASP's LLM Top 10 framework:

| ID | Title | Description |
|----|-------|-------------|
| **LLM01** | Prompt Injection | Trick models into revealing secrets, bypassing instructions |
| **LLM02** | Sensitive Information Disclosure | Accidental leakage of PII, financial data |
| **LLM03** | Supply Chain | Risk from external components or poisoned datasets |
| **LLM04** | Data / Model Poisoning | Malicious manipulation of training data or weights |
| **LLM05** | Improper Output Handling | LLM-generated XSS, SQLi, RCE |
| **LLM06** | Excessive Agency | Unchecked plugin/API interaction causing harm |
| **LLM07** | System Prompt Leakage | Leaking internal system instructions or secrets |
| **LLM08** | Vector & Embedding Weaknesses | Attacks via vector stores & embeddings |
| **LLM09** | Misinformation | Hallucinated or biased outputs causing harm |
| **LLM10** | Unbounded Consumption | Abuse via DoS or unauthorized model replication |
